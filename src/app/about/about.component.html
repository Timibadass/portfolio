  <p>Simple,quiet guy.</p>
  <p>I like to think of different ways to solve problems.</p>
  <p>I'm a Barcelona fan and I also love my country's football team.I love to play FIFA whenever I'm not writing code,I'm no FIFA god but I try and there's a good chance anyone would beat me.I also play a bit of volleyball to keep fit every now and then.</p>
  <p>Other than games and sports,I sometimes write about life issues and things I learn during my journey as a Developer.</p>
  <p>I'm a fan of Kanye West and Hip Hop..it often times makes me feel good.</p>
