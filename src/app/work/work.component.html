      <h5>Personal Website</h5>
      <p>I built this site after seeing how <a href="https://timiajiboye.com">this</a> site and <a href="https://opemipo.com">this</a> site didn't need to refresh the browser to fetch a new page.It was a rough way but I was able to use my CSS and jQuery to pull it off and it helped me understand css transitions and Off Canvas technique.</p>
